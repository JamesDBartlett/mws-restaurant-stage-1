# Front End Web Development Nanodegree -- Project 5

#### Restaurant Reviews App

Note to reviewer: If you are viewing this project on GitHub, you will find that the Mapbox API key is stored in an obfuscated JavaScript file under the `js` folder, called `key.js.` Due to the code obfuscator's self-defense mechanisms, you will probably have a pretty hard time doing any code inspection, so if you need to do a deep dive into my JavaScript, I suggest you do the following:
1) Clone the repo to your local machine.
2) Delete the file `js/key.js`.
3) Open the file `key_replace.js`, paste your own Mapbox API key into the `mapbox_api` object (between the single quotes), then save the file, and rename it to `key.js`.
4) Launch the python localhost server with this command: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
5) Manually clear your browser cache, unregister the old service worker, and do a hard refresh.
6) That's it!

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
